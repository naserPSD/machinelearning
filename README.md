# Twitter Sentimental Analysis By Using Machine Learning Approaches
Abstract—
Twitter sentiment analysis involves analyzing users' tweets
on the popular microblogging and social networking
platform to understand their thoughts, interests, and
opinions. This project focuses on performing sentiment
analysis on Twitter data using multiple classifiers: Naive
Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and
Decision Tree. In this paper we used dataset name as
Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset, which contains 74682
lengths of the Total datasets. To begin, a dataset of tweets
related to a specific topic or product is collected and preprocessed. The classifiers are trained to learn patterns and
make predictions about the sentiment expressed in tweets.
To assess the performance of the classifiers, metrics such as
the Confusion Matrix are used. Once the models are
trained, they are utilized to classify new tweets and analyze
the overall sentiment towards the given topic or product.
This analysis provides valuable insights for businesses and
organizations, enabling them to make informed decisions
and improve their offerings based on user sentiment. In
this project we trained The Logistic Regression, Random
Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), and Decision Tree, from which contains 86%, 91%,
74%, 89%, and 80% of the accuracy of individual models.

INTRODUCTION—
Sentiment Analysis is a valuable technique for analyzing text
data and classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. With
the rise of social media platforms like Twitter, sentiment
analysis has gained popularity as a means to extract opinion
and sentiment from user-generated content. Twitter serves as
a rich source of data where users freely express their
thoughts and sentiments on various topics. In this project, we
aim to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using
multiple classifiers: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision
Tree. These classifiers are commonly employed in natural
language processing, text classification, and sentiment
analysis tasks. We will collect Twitter data related to a
specific topic and utilize Python as the programming
language for implementation. We will leverage libraries such
as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to preprocess the data,
including tasks like text cleaning, stop word removal, and
stemming. For each classifier, we will train a model using
the preprocessed data. These models will learn patterns and
correlations in the data to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. To evaluate the performance of each classifier, we will employ metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Additionally, we will utilize the Confusion Matrix to gain insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Finally, we will utilize the trained models to classify new tweets and analyze the overall sentiment towards the topic or product of interest. This analysis will provide valuable insights to businesses and organizations, enabling them to improve their products, services, or public image based on Twitter user sentiment. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree classifiers for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. By employing these models, we can uncover valuable sentiment insights and aid decision-making processes in various domains.

CONCLUSION—
Sentiment Analysis is a method for analyzing text
data and categorizing it as positive, negative,
neutral or irrelevant. Social media sites like Twitter
have developed into significant sentiment and
opinion data sources in recent years. In this project,
we attempt to categorize messages from Twitter
into "positive" or "negative" emotions by
developing a model based on probabilities. To
determine if a sentence is favorable or negative,
sentiment analysis employs five models: Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, K- Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random
Forest. In accordance with the parameter space of
the model, we performed the best hyper parameter.
From table-01 Random Forest gives the best
accuracy ( 0.91), which refers to 91% accuracy;
after that, KNN gives the second highest result
according to this accuracy (0.89), which is 89%.
Then Logistic Regression gives (0.86), which is
86%., Decision Tree performs an accuracy of
(0.80), which is 80 %, and at last Naive Bayes
performs an accuracy of (0.74), that's a mean of 74
% accuracy. This is actually ourcomparison dataset
models which refers the best model is Random
Forest among all the models according to our
predictions.
